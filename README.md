# Decentralized Voting System

## Project Description

The Decentralized Voting System is a blockchain-based voting platform built on Ethereum using Solidity smart contracts. This system ensures transparency, immutability, and security in the voting process by leveraging the decentralized nature of blockchain technology. The platform eliminates the need for intermediaries and provides a trustless environment where votes are recorded permanently on the blockchain.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize democratic processes by creating a transparent, secure, and accessible voting system that can be used for elections, governance decisions, and organizational voting. We aim to build trust in electoral systems by providing complete transparency while maintaining voter privacy and preventing fraud through blockchain technology.
